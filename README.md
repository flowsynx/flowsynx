FlowSynx is a **next-generation workflow orchestration platform** that unifies **automation, scalability, and extensibility** in a single, developer-friendly ecosystem.  
It bridges the gap between **low-code simplicity** and **full-code power**, allowing both developers and operations teams to automate complex tasks seamlessly across **on-prem**, **cloud**, and **hybrid** environments.

Whether you’re streamlining **DevOps**, managing **data pipelines**, or building **enterprise-grade automations**, FlowSynx gives you the control, flexibility, and insight to make it happen.

## What is FlowSynx?

In today’s fast-moving software landscape, organizations demand **repeatable**, **modular**, and **secure** automation — without the lock-in of rigid platforms.

**FlowSynx** redefines orchestration with:
- A **.NET-based micro-kernel engine** built for speed and reliability  
- A **plugin-driven architecture** that evolves with your needs  
- A **JSON-based DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** workflow model that’s both human-readable and machine-friendly  

FlowSynx turns your processes — from data management to API and ML/AI automation — into **clear, maintainable, and reusable workflows**.

## How It Works

At its core, FlowSynx executes **DAG-based workflows** where each task represents an atomic operation — reading data, transforming it, sending HTTP requests, or interacting with external systems.

### Core Concepts

- **Workflow JSON** — Define tasks, dependencies, and parameters in simple JSON  
- **Plugins** — Modular building blocks for any functionality (file I/O, APIs, cloud storage, data transformation, ML/AI, etc.)  
- **Execution Engine** — Smart orchestration with:
  - Task dependency resolution (topological sorting)
  - Shared execution context and secure state handling
  - Async execution, retries, and timeouts
  - Built-in logging, metrics, and auditing

## Task Lifecycle

Every task flows through a predictable, reliable lifecycle:

1. **Initialization** – Validates plugin and parameters  
2. **Dependency Wait** – Ensures prerequisite tasks are done  
3. **Execution** – Runs the plugin logic (e.g., `ReadAsync`, `WriteAsync`)  
4. **Error Handling** – Retries, fallbacks, or workflow failover  
5. **Post-Processing** – Logs, stores outputs, and passes results downstream  

## Execution Modes

Choose how you run FlowSynx — on your terms:

| Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Standalone** | Lightweight binary for local or embedded use |
| **Dockerized** | Ready for CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes clusters |
| **API Mode** | Trigger workflows via REST APIs |
| **CLI (`flowctl`)** | Command-line power for developers |

## Runtime Context

- Shared Variables  
- Secure Secrets Management  
- Plugin Buffers & Metadata  
- Real-Time State Tracking  

## Why FlowSynx?

Modern automation is complex — but it doesn’t have to be **complicated**.

FlowSynx is designed to:
- **Empower developers** with modularity and openness  
- **Simplify operations** through declarative configuration  
- **Bridge teams** across development, data, and business processes  
- **Scale effortlessly** across environments  

Built on clean architecture principles, FlowSynx offers **clarity**, **control**, and **confidence** — even in the most demanding automation scenarios.

## Key Features

✅ **Plugin-Based Extensibility** — Add, upgrade, or remove capabilities dynamically and version-controlled  
✅ **Cross-Platform Execution** — Runs everywhere (Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker, Cloud)  
✅ **JSON-Defined Workflows** — Declarative, portable, and version-controlled  
✅ **CLI & SDK Support** — Total control for developers and DevOps teams  
✅ **Secure Authentication** — JWT, Basic Auth  
✅ **Triggers & Events** — Webhooks, schedules, and file-change detection  
✅ **Human-in-the-Loop Tasks** — Combine automation with human approval  
✅ **Advanced Logging & Auditing** — Full transparency into every execution  
✅ **Error Handling** - Flexible Error Handling and Retry Policies per task and workflow level  
✅ **Marketplace & Registry** — Discover and manage plugins easily  
✅ **Web Console UI** — Intuitive dashboard for workflow monitoring and control  

## Roadmap

Curious about what’s next? Review the planned milestones in our [Roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Get Started using FlowSynx

Ready to try FlowSynx? Start automating in minutes.

📘 **Documentation:** [Getting Started Guide](https://flowsynx.io/docs/getting-started)  
🧩 **Samples:** [Example Workflows & Configs](https://github.com/flowsynx/samples)  

## Build from Source

Want to contribute or run FlowSynx locally? Use this quickstart to build from source in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) — confirm with `dotnet --version` (should report 9.x)
- Git

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx
cd flowsynx
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test
```

- Commands are cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Build artifacts land in each project's `bin/Release` directory.

For advanced workflows (Docker, local environment setup, contributing guidelines), see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration Sources

FlowSynx now supports selecting its configuration provider at startup. By default it reads from the bundled `appsettings*.json` files, but you can switch to [Infisical](https://infisical.com/) without recompiling the application.

- **Environment variable:** set `FLOWSYNX_CONFIG_SOURCE=Infisical`.
- **Command-line argument:** pass `--config-source=Infisical` (or `--config-source Infisical`).
- **Fallback:** if Infisical is unreachable and fallback is enabled, FlowSynx logs a warning and reverts to the JSON files so the service can still boot.

Configure the Infisical connection via the `Infisical` section (or matching environment variables):

```json
"Infisical": {
  "Enabled": true,
  "HostUri": "https://app.infisical.com",
  "ProjectId": "<project-id>",
  "EnvironmentSlug": "<environment-slug>",
  "SecretPath": "/",
  "FallbackToAppSettings": true,
  "MachineIdentity": {
    "ClientId": "<machine-identity-client-id>",
    "ClientSecret": "<machine-identity-client-secret>"
  }
}
```

Refer to [docs/infisical-configuration.md](./docs/infisical-configuration.md) for end-to-end setup guidance, including secret naming conventions and recommended access policies.
